All icons are placed in 'Icons' folder.
*.nupkg files can be extracted like *.zip files (e.g. with 7-zip).

Ignore other folders, because they are just needed for handling of the nuget package in TcHmi engineering.
Handling of nuget packages in TcHmi engineering will be supported in release 1.12.

Requests for changes on available icons or new icons can be send to d.nowak@beckhoff.com.
Confirmed edits will then be delivered in a next version of the package.

Icons are colored related to the TcHmi theme.
Icons do not have a background color because they are meant to be used on a TcHmiButton which has already a background color.
